# RegexSequencer
Sublime Text plugin providing command to prcess text by performing a sequens of regex find/replace operations and commands on it.
Defined sequeces are available from context menu.

For exaples of use check [Context.sublime-menu](https://github.com/kolekcjonerKapsli/RegexSequencer/blob/master/Context.sublime-menu) file, there are three demo sequences defined as args of the command.
Same way you can add your own sequences which will be available from context menu.

To add your own context menu command (sequence) open menu 'Sublime Text/Preferences/Regex Sequencer/Edit Context Menu - User'
In the file you can define your own context menu commands or override already defined by copying it from 'Sublime Text/Preferences/Regex Sequencer/Context Menu - Default' and modifying.

I will show you how later.
